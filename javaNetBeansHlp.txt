java -jar HelloWorldApp.jar
java -jar MyApp.jar However we all feel zealous
(C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51\bin\java -jar HelloWorldApp.jar)

A Java Class Library project
- MyLib (.\lib)

Add Project JAR Files
---------------------
- Right-click the Libraries node for the MyApp project and 
choose Add Project. 
- The MyLib project's JAR file is added to the MyApp 
project's classpath.

Creating a Java Package and Class File
--------------------------------------
- Right-click the MyLib project node and choose New > Java Class
- LibClass as the name for the new class
- org.me.mylib in the Package field

To add the arguments for the IDE to use when 
running the application:
------------------------
- Right-click the MyApp project node, choose Properties
- Select the "Run" node in the dialog's left pane

Running the Application
-----------------------
- Right-click the MyApp project node and choose 
Clean and Build
- Run > Run Project (F6)

Testing and Debugging the Application
-------------------------------------
Creating JUnit Tests:
- Right-click the LibClass.java node in the Projects window,
  and choose Tools > Create/Update Tests (Ctrl-Shift-U).
- In LibClassTest.java, delete the body of the 
  public void testAcrostic() method. 
  
(Reformat: Alt + Shift + F)

Running JUnit Tests:
- Select the MyLib project node and choose 
  Run > Test Project (MyLib) or press Alt-F6.  
- You can also run a single test file rather 
  than testing the entire project. Select the 
  "LibClass.java" tab in the Source Editor
  and choose  Run > Test File (Ctl + F6).

Debugging the Application
-------------------------
- In the LibClass.java file, go to the acrostic method 
  and place the insertion point anywhere inside 
  b.append(args[i].charAt(i));. Then press Ctrl-F8 
  to set a breakpoint.
- Select the MyApp project node and choose 
  Debug > Debug Project (Ctrl-F5).
- Press F7 (or choose Debug > Step Into) 
  to step through the program  


Building, Running, and Distributing the Application  
---------------------------------------------------  
Building the Application:
- The main build command in the IDE is the 
  "Clean and Build" command:
  Run > Clean and Build Project (Shift-F11)  

Distributing the Application to Other Users
-------------------------------------------
- Create a zip file that contains the application 
  JAR file (MyApp.jar) and the accompanying lib folder 
  that contains MyLib.jar.

Making the Javadoc Available in the IDE
---------------------------------------
