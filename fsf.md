Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their
programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the
program. By contrast, most software carries fine print that denies users
these basic rights, leaving them susceptible to the whims of its owners
and vulnerable to surveillance.

-   The FSF provides critical infrastructure and funding for the [GNU
    Project](https://gnu.org), the foundation of the popular GNU/Linux
    family of free operating systems and the keystone of the Internet.
-   Our [Campaigns Team](https://www.fsf.org/campaigns) creates
    educational materials about free software, convenes the yearly
    [LibrePlanet conference](https://libreplanet.org/conference) and
    goes toe to toe against powerful interests that threaten computer
    user rights.
-   Our [Licensing & Compliance Lab](https://www.fsf.org/licensing)
    defends freely licensed software from proprietary hoarding, advises
    on licensing issues, and certifies devices that [Respect Your
    Freedom](https://www.fsf.org/ryf).

**With your support, we\'ve done these things for more than 30 years.
Help sustain us for many more; [please become a member
